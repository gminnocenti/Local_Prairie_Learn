# pl-graph-animate

## Introduction

The `pl-graph-animate` element is a powerful tool for creating engaging and visually dynamic animations of graph-related problems within the PrairieLearn platform. Designed to aid in the teaching and learning of graph algorithms, this element offers a flexible approach to building animations that showcase how these algorithms operate step-by-step.

`pl-graph-animate` provides two intuitive methods to generate animations:

### Algorithm-Based Animation: 
   Create animations by defining a graph through its adjacency matrix and specifying an algorithm to execute. Currently supported algorithms include:
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
   - Depth-First Search (DFS)
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm  

   This method automates the animation process, providing a clear visualization of how the selected algorithm traverses or processes the graph.

### Custom Frame-Based Animation  
   For users seeking complete control, this method allows you to define animations frame-by-frame using a dictionary of DOT commands. This approach is ideal for creating highly customized or unconventional graph visualizations tailored to specific needs.
