    <h1>Identify the Algorithm: BFS or DFS?</h1>
    <p>
        Now that you have observed videos of both <strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</strong> and 
        <strong>Depth-First Search (DFS)</strong>, itâ€™s time to test your understanding. In the following video, 
        you will see an algorithm being executed on a graph. Your task is to identify whether the algorithm being used is 
        <strong>BFS</strong> or <strong>DFS</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>To help you make the distinction:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>BFS</strong> explores nodes <strong>level by level</strong>, visiting all nodes at the same distance from the starting node before moving deeper.</li>
        <li><strong>DFS</strong> dives as deep as possible along one branch before <strong>backtracking</strong> to explore other branches.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>After watching the video, identify which algorithm was used in the graph traversal.</h4>
