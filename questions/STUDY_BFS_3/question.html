    <h1>Understanding Why BFS Visits Nodes Based on Level Order</h1>
    <p>
        In <strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</strong>, we visit nodes 
        <strong>level by level</strong>, starting from the initial node 
        (in this case, Node 0) and moving outward. BFS explores each level fully 
        before moving on to the next one, always visiting nodes closest to the starting point first.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this example, Nodes 1 and 2 are directly connected to Node 0, so they’re part of 
        the first level. Nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6 are connected to Nodes 1 and 2, making them part 
        of the next level. According to BFS, we should visit nodes connected to Node 1 and Node 2 
        before going deeper into nodes connected to 3 or 4.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since Nodes 5 and 6 are directly connected to Node 2, BFS will visit them 
        <strong>from Node 2 first</strong>, rather than waiting until we visit 
        Nodes 3 and 4. This keeps the exploration in order from the closest level outwards, 
        ensuring that every node is reached as quickly as possible from the starting point.

<h2>Incorrect BFS Execution</h2>
<p>
    The following video shows an <strong>incorrect execution</strong> of 
    Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a <strong>different graph.</strong> In BFS, nodes should be expanded 
    <strong>level by level</strong>, starting with the initial node and visiting 
    each node in the closest level before moving to the next.
</p>
<p>
    In a correct BFS, this level-by-level expansion ensures that all nodes directly connected 
    to the current node are fully explored before the search goes deeper into the graph. 
    As you watch the video, pay attention to where the algorithm deviates from this level order, 
    leading to an incorrect traversal path.

<h4>After reviewing the incorrect execution of Breadth-First Search (BFS), identify the first step that was wrongly executed. What was the mistake, and why does it violate the BFS approach?</h4>

<pl-multiple-choice answers-name="acc" weight="1">
    <pl-answer correct="false">Step 3: Node 3 was visited before Node 2, even though both should have been explored in the correct order within the same level.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="false">Step 6: Node 5 was revisited after being correctly visited from Node 3, creating an unnecessary step and violating BFS’s single-visit rule.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="false">Step 4: Node 4 was revisited after Node 3, introducing redundancy and breaking the BFS rule of visiting nodes only once.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="true">Step 5: Node 5 was visited from Node 3 before Node 4 was fully explored from Node 2. This violates BFS because it skips a node in the current level and moves to a deeper level prematurely.</pl-answer>
