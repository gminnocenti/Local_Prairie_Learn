    <h1>Understanding Backtracking in Depth-First Search (DFS)</h1>
    <p>
        In Depth-First Search (DFS), <strong>backtracking</strong> is a key part of how we explore 
        all paths in a graph. DFS is designed to go as deep as possible along one path, moving from 
        node to node until it reaches a point where it can’t go further. When there are no new nodes 
        left to explore on a path, DFS “backtracks” to the previous node to see if there’s another path 
        it hasn’t explored yet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Imagine walking down a long hallway with many doors. You open each door you find, and keep 
        going down any hallway behind each door as far as you can. When you reach a dead end, you go back 
        to the last door you didn’t open, exploring down that path. This “backtracking” approach allows 
        DFS to fully explore each branch before moving on, ensuring that no paths are missed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Backtracking is essential in DFS because it ensures that <strong>all possible paths</strong> from 
        the starting point are explored. It’s different from other search methods that explore level by level. 
        DFS dives deep first and only returns (or “backtracks”) when it needs to explore other branches.
    </p>
    <h4>DFS Traversal Explanation</h4>
    <p>
        In Depth-First Search (DFS), we start at the initial node (Node 0) and explore as far along 
        each path as possible before backtracking. The traversal order for this DFS execution is 
        <strong>[0, 1, 3, 5, 4, 2, 6]</strong>, which reflects how DFS fully explores each branch before moving to the next.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Starting at Node 0</strong>: DFS begins at Node 0 and chooses the smallest numbered connected node, which is <strong>Node 1</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploring Node 1</strong>: From Node 1, DFS dives further into its branch, going to <strong>Node 3</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Reaching Node 3</strong>: Continuing down this path, DFS visits <strong>Node 5</strong> (the only connected node from Node 3).</li>
        <li><strong>Backtracking to Node 1</strong>: After reaching Node 5 with no further connections, DFS backtracks to <strong>Node 1</strong> to explore any remaining nodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Visiting Node 4</strong>: DFS then explores the next branch of Node 1 by visiting <strong>Node 4</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Backtracking to Node 0</strong>: With Node 1 fully explored, DFS backtracks to <strong>Node 0</strong> and moves to the next branch by visiting <strong>Node 2</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploring Node 2</strong>: From Node 2, DFS visits its connected node, <strong>Node 6</strong>, completing the traversal.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This order ensures that DFS explores each path to its end before returning to previous nodes to check for other unexplored paths. 
        The traversal stops only once all nodes have been visited. This depth-first approach is distinct from breadth-first search, 
        as DFS prioritizes going deeper into each branch before backtracking.

    <h2>Incorrect DFS Execution</h2>
    <p>
        The following video shows an <strong>incorrect execution</strong> of 
        Depth-First Search (DFS) on a <strong>different graph.</strong> In DFS, the algorithm 
        should go as far as possible down each path before <strong>backtracking</strong> to explore 
        other branches. DFS explores deeply before returning to the previous node only when necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a correct DFS, this deep exploration ensures that each branch is fully explored 
        before moving back to cover other paths. As you watch the video, pay close attention 
        to where the algorithm <strong>deviates from this depth-first approach</strong>, particularly 
        in moments where it should backtrack but instead moves prematurely to another branch.

<h4>After reviewing the incorrect execution of Depth-First Search (DFS), identify the first step that was wrongly executed. What was the mistake, and why does it violate the DFS approach?</h4>

<pl-multiple-choice answers-name="acc" weight="1">
    <pl-answer correct="true">Step 6: The algorithm backtracked to Node 0 and expanded Node 3 before fully exploring Node 5. This violates the DFS principle, as DFS should finish exploring a branch completely before moving to a different branch.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="false">Step 4: The algorithm incorrectly revisited Node 1 after visiting Node 2, breaking the DFS approach by creating unnecessary redundancy.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="false">Step 5: The algorithm visited Node 5 from Node 2 before Node 3, which is out of order for DFS.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="false">Step 7: Node 6 was visited after revisiting Node 5, which violates DFS’s single-visit rule by revisiting nodes unnecessarily.</pl-answer>
