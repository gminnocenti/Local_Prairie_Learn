    <h1>What is Breadth-First Search (BFS)?</h1>
    <p>
        Breadth-First Search, or BFS, is a way of exploring a graph <strong>level by level</strong>. 
        Imagine the graph as a set of connected points, called "nodes." BFS starts from a chosen 
        starting node and explores all nodes directly connected to it first—these make up the 
        <strong>first level</strong>. After exploring the first level, BFS moves to the 
        <strong>second level</strong>, where it visits each node connected to the first level nodes, 
        and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
        This level-by-level approach continues until all nodes connected to the starting point 
        have been explored. By visiting nodes in this order, BFS spreads out evenly across the graph, 
        exploring each level fully before moving to the next.

<h2>Observe the Incorrect Execution of BFS</h2>
<p>
    In the following video, you will see Breadth-First Search (BFS) being executed <strong>incorrectly</strong> on the same graph. 
    Please watch carefully and identify where the algorithm deviates from the correct process.
</p>
<p>
    Look for the step or steps that weren’t performed as expected, paying special attention to the 
    <strong>level-by-level order</strong> in which nodes should be visited.

<h4>After reviewing the incorrect execution of Breadth-First Search (BFS), identify the first step that was wrongly executed. What was the mistake, and why does it violate the BFS approach?</h4>

<pl-multiple-choice answers-name="acc" weight="1">
    <pl-answer correct="false">Step 2: Node 1 was revisited unnecessarily, which is not required in BFS.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="true">Step 3: Node 3 was visited before Node 2, which goes against BFS’s level-by-level traversal order.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="false">Step 5: Node 4 was visited twice, indicating a redundant step in the traversal.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="false">Step 4: Node 2 was visited, but it should have been visited immediately after Node 1 to maintain the level order.</pl-answer>
