    <h1>Understanding Node Visits in Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h1>
    <p>
        In Breadth-First Search (BFS), we explore nodes <strong>level by level</strong>. 
        When two nodes both have edges (connections) to the same node, BFS will only visit that node 
        once, usually from the <strong>first node that reaches it</strong>. This is because 
        BFS is designed to avoid visiting the same node multiple times to keep the search efficient and clear.
    </p>
    <p>
        Imagine a scenario where two friends both want to visit a mutual friend’s house. If one friend 
        arrives first, there’s no need for the other friend to bring them again—BFS works in a similar way. 
        Once a node is visited, BFS doesn’t need to visit it again, even if there are other paths leading to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        By following this approach, BFS ensures that every node is visited just once, saving time and making 
        it easier to follow the search path without revisiting.

<h2>The Importance of Expanding All Nodes in Each Level in BFS</h2>
<p>
    In <strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</strong>, it’s essential to explore 
    all nodes in the <strong>current level</strong> before moving to the next level. 
    This ensures that BFS explores nodes in the shortest path order from the starting point. 
    By expanding each level fully, BFS maintains its orderly progression, visiting nodes closest 
    to the start first and gradually expanding outward.
</p>
<p>
    If BFS were to skip nodes in the current level and jump ahead to the next, it would 
    break the level-by-level structure. This could lead to missing shorter paths and would 
    disrupt the search pattern. This is why, in BFS, every node at the current level must be 
    fully visited before moving on to nodes further away.

    <pl-answer correct="false">Step 6: Node 5 was revisited unnecessarily, which violates BFS by creating redundant steps and revisiting nodes.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="true">Step 4: Node 5 was visited before Node 4. This violates BFS by skipping nodes in the current level and jumping to a node in the next level.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="false">Step 5: Node 4 was visited after Node 3, but it should have been visited immediately after Node 2. This violates the level-by-level order in BFS.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="false">Step 3: Node 3 was visited out of order; it should have been visited only after all nodes in the current level were fully explored.</pl-answer>
