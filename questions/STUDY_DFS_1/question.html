    <h1>What is Depth-First Search (DFS)?</h1>
    <p>
        Depth-First Search, or DFS, is a method for exploring a graph by going as deep as possible along a branch before backtracking. 
        Imagine the graph as a collection of connected points, called "nodes." DFS starts from a chosen starting node and explores 
        one path all the way to the end, moving from one node to the next until it reaches a point where it can't go further.
    </p>
    <p>
        When DFS reaches the end of a branch or a node with no unvisited neighbors, it <strong>backtracks</strong> to the previous node 
        and continues exploring the next branch. This process of diving deep and then backtracking continues until all nodes connected 
        to the starting point have been visited.
    </p>
    <p>
        By exploring as far along each path as possible before switching paths, DFS follows a <strong>depth-first</strong> approach, 
        which is different from the level-by-level exploration of BFS.

    <h2>Observe the Incorrect Execution of DFS</h2>
    <p>
        In the following video, you will see Depth-First Search (DFS) being executed <strong>incorrectly</strong> on the same graph. 
        Please watch carefully and identify where the algorithm deviates from the correct process.
    </p>
    <p>
        Look for the step or steps that weren’t performed as expected, focusing on whether DFS correctly explores one path fully 
        before backtracking to explore other paths.

<h4>After reviewing the incorrect execution of Depth-First Search (DFS), identify the first step that was wrongly executed. What was the mistake, and why does it violate the DFS approach?</h4>

    <pl-answer correct="false">Step 5: Node 4 was revisited after being correctly visited from Node 3, creating an unnecessary step and violating DFS’s single-visit rule.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="false">Step 2: Node 1 was revisited after Node 2, disrupting the DFS depth-first path by revisiting nodes in the current branch.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="false">Step 4: Node 3 was revisited unnecessarily after Node 2, introducing redundancy and breaking the DFS rule of visiting nodes only once.</pl-answer>
    <pl-answer correct="true">Step 3: Node 2 was visited from Node 0 before fully exploring Node 1’s branch. This violates DFS, which requires each branch to be fully explored before moving to a different branch.</pl-answer>
