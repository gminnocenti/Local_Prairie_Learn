    <h1>Identify the Algorithm and Determine the Next Step</h1>
    <p>
        In the following video, you will see the first 4 steps of an algorithm being executed on a graph. 
        Your task is to identify which algorithm is being used — <strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</strong> or <strong>Depth-First Search (DFS)</strong> — 
        and determine the next step that should be executed according to the logic of the identified algorithm.
